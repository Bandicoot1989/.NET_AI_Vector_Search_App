The document emphasizes the importance of following these guidelines to protect company assets and maintain operational integrity.",
    "appliesTo": "All users that requires information about the IT equipment usage recommendations in Grupo Antolin.",
    "content": "## Equipment Usage\n\nThere are some basic recommendations to be followed by users in order to adequately use GA equipment:\n\n- **Never change the location** of any GA asset without informing (and obtaining authorization from) your Local IT Coordinator or Helpdesk\n- **Never change where a GA asset is plugged into.** This is valid for both electrical plugs and network points. In several locations, power sockets where IT equipment must be connected are different (normally are those identified in red). In those places only PC's and laptops can be connected there. Screens, printers, etc… cannot be plugged there. Those differentiated socket can provide electrical power in case of electrical fall as they are connected to an Uninterruptible Power Supply system.\n- **Never connect non-GA owned devices** into GA systems without explicit consent of your Local IT Coordinator or Helpdesk. Every single piece of hardware purchased in GA must be acquired as per the budget defined, following GA purchase procedures and must be always validated by DSI.\n- **Never connect non-GA computers to GA network.** Should any external contractor need access to our resources, this computer must be previously reviewed and validated by your Local IT Coordinator and/or Helpdesk. Access will only be authorized after proper modification of some parameters by GA IT personnel and/or using special accesses different form regular users' ones. **It's strictly prohibited to make use of personal IT assets in GA environments.**\n- **When leaving your desk**, always lock your computer screen by pressing `WIN key + L`.\n- **Should you suspect** your computer or any other asset belonging to the Company is affected by a virus or some other kind of Malware, please urgently report it to Helpdesk or your local IT Coordinator. On the other hand, should DSI will have suspicions on any out of normal behavior in any user's equipment, access to corporate resources must be restricted without warning in order to prevent damage to GA assets and operations.\n- **When finishing your work day**, please shutdown your computer. This is a wise, environmental friendly attitude that will help us to preserve our assets in an adequate state.\n\n## Laptops Usage\n\nLaptop computers are only assigned normally to those employees needing them for their daily work. In order to improve user experience, ensure a safe usage of corporate resources and improve duration of the laptop's batteries and its general performance, there are some basic recommendations to be followed:\n\n- **When moving a laptop inside a location**, suspend or hibernate it and always keep it screen completely closed (i.e. when bringing it into a meeting room or another location within the same building). Carrying laptops as a waiter's tray it's a bad idea.\n- **In general**, avoid moving the laptop between places with the computer powered on. Always keep the laptop switched off while travelling.\n- **When your laptop is not going to be moved** from its usual place for a long time is highly recommendable to lock it to the table using the security lock cable provided, remove the battery and keep it with some load.\n- **Pay special attention** when wrapping your cables to put them into your bag. If you have to untangle them continuously you will decrease dramatically its performance and will stop working soon.\n\n## Laptops Outside Company Premises\n\nAdditionally, whenever a GA laptop leaves GA premises, some extra care measures must be observed regarding information security:\n\n- **Laptops and any other IT equipment** will always be carried with the user as hand luggage while travelling in public transport. They should be never checked in.\n- **While being carried in any other vehicle**, IT equipment must be kept off sight and may not be easily accessible. If we have to abandon that vehicle or left it unattended, user must have utmost care and ensure it is kept locked and in the safest place possible within the vehicle. Should this cannot be guaranteed, it's always preferred to keep the laptop and its transport bag with us wherever we may go.\n- **When your laptop is to remain for a time** in a place without surveillance, please use the security lock provided. If not possible, please keep in a safe cabinet or bring it with you at all times.\n- **GA assets should not be connected** to any non-GA network except for connecting into GA resources using a secure VPN client. If connected, utmost care must be applied and no confidential data should be transmitted using unsecure means.\n- **Should you suffer any incident** with your assigned laptop (It disappears or get stolen) please warn immediately DSI via Helpdesk or your local IT Coordinator, in order to put in place all measures required to prevent unauthorized access to Company's relevant data.",
